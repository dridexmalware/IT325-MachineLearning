ðŸ’¡ As an IT student delving into machine learning, I now have a better understanding of linear and logistic regression. Linear regression is crucial for predicting continuous outcomes to understand relationships in data analytics. On the other hand, logistic regression is used to predict categorical outcomes hence easily understand intricate decision scenarios. The experiences drawn from the hands-on examples above made me understand the weight of data quality, visualization, and preprocessing. Predicting numerical values varies from classifying data point by classification and prominent outcomes from the two regression analyses. This trip has enhanced my said ability and has provided me with relevant tools to handle various problems when looking at information technology. This will also help us in demystifying the machine learning topic more since we are going to use it in our Capstone Project.
